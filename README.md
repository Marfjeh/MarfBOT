# DEPRECATED

Project is discontuined, this branch [DEV2][2] Is a Non-Working version of the rewrite of my bot that never got used in production.



The [Production][0] branch is as the name says, used on my production server. that was online until October 2019.


Where [Dev][1] is the Dev branch of Production.


Branch [Java][3] Is a recreation of MarfBOT In Java, This got used partially in production. Only the music part because of lavaplayer. But never completed and never replaced the old legacy nOdE.JS bot.


There was also a Typescript port, but i've lost it, it should be here somewhere still..



### I will not give any support for setting it up or what ever. There is also no need to make pull-requests or issues as this project is dead.


Maybe someone can make use of this horrible mess. Or have a good laughter :)

This was also my very first node.js program. Now i've learned how horrible node.js is.
